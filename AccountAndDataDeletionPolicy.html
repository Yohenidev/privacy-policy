<h1>Account and Data Deletion Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 23, 2025</p>
 
  <p>This Account and Data Deletion Policy explains how users of the mobile application <strong>“Flagship – Bella Group”</strong> (“the App”), published by <strong>Technology Partners, LLC</strong>, may delete their accounts and associated data.</p>
 
  <h2>1. Self-Initiated Account Deletion (In-App)</h2>
<p>You can delete your account directly from within the App at any time by navigating to <em>Account Settings</em> and selecting the <em>Delete Account</em> option. No email request is required for standard users.</p>
<p>When you confirm the deletion, you will be logged out immediately and your account will enter the deletion process. A confirmation message will be displayed within the App, and you will also receive an email confirmation sent to the address linked to your account.</p>
 
  <h2>2. Data Deleted</h2>
<p>When you delete your account, the following data will be permanently deleted from our systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account details (name, email, phone number)</li>
<li>Vehicle information linked to your account</li>
<li>Authentication data and login credentials</li>
<li>App preferences and stored profile information</li>
</ul>
 
  <h2>3. Data Retained</h2>
<p>Some data may be retained temporarily or permanently where required by law, regulatory obligations, or legitimate business needs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transaction records (retained for accounting, tax, or compliance purposes)</li>
<li>Legal records related to fraud prevention, security, or dispute resolution</li>
<li>Aggregated or anonymized usage data that does not identify you personally</li>
</ul>
<p>Any retained data will be minimized and anonymized wherever possible.</p>
 
  <h2>4. Timing of Deletion</h2>
<p>Account and data deletion requests initiated in-app are typically processed immediately. Certain data may take up to <strong>30 days</strong> to be fully removed from active systems and backups. Backups are systematically purged in accordance with our standard data retention schedule, which is no longer than <strong>90 days</strong>.</p>
 
  <h2>5. Subscriptions</h2>
<p>The App does not provide paid subscriptions or recurring billing features. Therefore, there are no subscription accounts to manage or cancel as part of the deletion process.</p>
 
  <h2>6. Alternative Deletion Requests</h2>
<p>While the standard method of account deletion is self-service in-app, if you encounter technical difficulties you may also contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tppr.com">support@tppr.com</a>. Please include the email address associated with your account for verification.</p>
 
  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data at any time. To exercise these rights, use the in-app account management tools or contact us directly. We will respond to valid requests in accordance with applicable privacy laws.</p>
 
  <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
