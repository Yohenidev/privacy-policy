  <p>This End User License Agreement (“Agreement” or “EULA”) is a legal contract between you (“User”) and <strong>Technology Partners, LLC</strong> (“Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), governing your use of the mobile application <strong>“Flagship – Bella Group”</strong> (“the App”).</p>
 
  <h2>1. License Grant</h2>

<li>Use the App in a manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair our services.</li>
</ul>
 
  <h2>4. User Accounts and Data</h2>
<p>Use of the App may require you to create an account. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities conducted under your account.</p>
<p>Your account and data handling are governed by our <a href="https://yohenidev.github.io/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and our <a href="https://yohenidev.github.io/privacy-policy/AccountAndDataDeletionPolicy.html" target="_blank">Account and Data Deletion Policy</a>, both of which are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.</p>

  <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and, where applicable, the federal laws of the United States. However, if you are a resident of another country, you may also be entitled to the protection of mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence.</p>
 
  <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall first be attempted to be resolved amicably. If unresolved, disputes shall be submitted to binding arbitration in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
 
  <h2>14. Apple App Store Third-Party Beneficiary</h2>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Apple Inc. and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that upon your acceptance of the terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary.</p>
