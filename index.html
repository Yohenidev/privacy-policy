<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 23, 2025</p>
 
  <p><strong>Technology Partners, LLC</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is the developer and publisher of the mobile application <strong>“Flagship – Bella Group”</strong> (“the App”). We respect and protect the privacy of all users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data, especially in relation to the permissions requested by the App.</p>
 
  <h2>Permissions We Use</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet:</strong> Required to allow secure communication between the App and our servers.</li>
<li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used only to scan QR codes or capture images required for specific features. Photos and videos are not stored or shared by us.</li>
<li><strong>Flashlight:</strong> Activated only when using the camera for scanning or capturing. No data is collected.</li>
<li><strong>Location (Fine/Coarse):</strong> Used to provide location-based features such as nearby service centers. Location data is processed in real time and is not shared with third parties.</li>
<li><strong>Biometric/Fingerprint Authentication:</strong> Used solely for secure device-level login. Biometric data never leaves your device and is not stored by us.</li>
</ul>
 
  <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
<p>To provide core functionality, the App requires you to create an account and provide certain personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number, and vehicle details. This information is stored securely on our servers and used only to deliver app features, maintain your account, and ensure proper service functionality.</p>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for advertising purposes.</p>
 
  <h2>Consent</h2>
<p>All permissions are requested using standard operating system consent prompts. You are asked to grant or deny access before any permission-based feature is used. You may revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings.</p>
 
  <h2>Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
<ul>
<li>We do not sell or rent your personal information.</li>
<li>We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> and <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong>, services provided by Google LLC, to collect app usage statistics and crash reports. This helps us improve stability, performance, and user experience.</li>
<li>Data collected through Firebase may include device information, app usage patterns, and crash diagnostics. This information is processed by Google in accordance with their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
 
  <h2>Data Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>All communication between the App and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.</li>
<li>Sensitive data, such as authentication information, is securely handled and never stored beyond what is necessary for functionality.</li>
<li>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data.</li>
</ul>
 
  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain your account information for as long as your account is active. You may request account deletion at any time (see below). Temporary data used for features such as camera or location is discarded immediately after use.</p>
 
  <h2>Account and Data Deletion</h2>
<p>You may delete your account at any time directly through the App by using the <em>Delete Account</em> option in the account settings. When you delete your account, all personal data associated with your account is permanently removed from our systems within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is required by law.</p>
<p>If you need assistance with account or data deletion, you may also contact us at the email provided below.</p>
 
  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to access, update, correct, or delete your personal data stored in connection with the App. To exercise these rights, please use the in-app account management tools or contact us directly. We will respond to all valid requests in accordance with applicable privacy laws.</p>
 
  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will promptly delete it.</p>
 
  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised “Effective Date.”</p>
